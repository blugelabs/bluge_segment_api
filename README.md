# Bluge Segment API

[![PkgGoDev](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/github.com/blugelabs/bluge_segment_api)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/blugelabs/bluge_segment_api)

These interfaces define the relationship between Bluge and it's segment file formats.

The expectation is that these interfaces can be well-defined, and evolve slowly.  By doing so, Bluge and the file formats themselves can evolve more quickly, and yet remain compatible.
